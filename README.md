Check Your Understanding

1. I will choose to fit the test within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This allows us to test a small amount of code instead of testing a lot of things at the same time, which will be very confusing and time-consuming. Also, if I choose manually run them locally before pushing the code, I may forget about it from time to time. As we fit the test within a Github action, it will help to keep track of the current progress on time, which will be very helpful. 

2. No, as we need to use a unit test for it. 

3. No, unit tests are for us to check if the function can return the correct output. End-to-end tests will perform better in this case as we need multiple components that interact with each other.  

4. Yes, to test the max message length, we just need to get the max message length and compare it with a certain number. As it just needs individual components and does not needs interact with each other on an application/feature level. We can use unit tests in this case.
